There's also\r\na lot of ugly code in there, If you stumble on something, raise an issue (or submit a pull request :) )\r\n\r\nAlso, the bulk of the dao.cfc stuff was developed in CF7-8 erra, and has been patched CF9/10 features started creeping in.  I \r\nam in the process of re-writing the library using the query.cfc and some other things that will break the pre-CF9 compatibility.\r\nFor instance, this is being re-written using all script based code.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\nThe goal of this library is to allow one to interact with the database in a DB platform agnostic way, \r\nwhile making it super easy.  \r\n\r\nThere are two parts to this library, the first is for a more traditional DAO\r\ntype interaction where one uses a handful of CRUD functions:\r\n* `dao.insert()`\r\n* `dao.read()`\r\n* `dao.update()`\r\n* `dao.delete()`\r\n\r\nas well as a general `dao.execute()` to run arbitrary SQL against the database.\r\n\r\nUsing the built-in methods for CRUD provides some benefits such as being database agnostic,\r\nproviding optional \"onFinish\" callbacks functions, transaction logging (for custom replication).\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nCopy the \"database\" folder `(/src/com/database)` into your project (or into the folder you place your components)\r\n\r\n# DAO Examples:\r\n```javascript\r\n\t// create instance of DAO - must feed it a datasource name\r\n\tdao = new com.database.dao( dsn = \"dao\" ); // note: dbtype is optional and defaults to MySQL\r\n\t\r\n\t// Insert data (could have easily been a form struct)\r\n\tDATA = { \r\n\t\t\t\"_id\" = lcase(createUUID()), \r\n\t\t\t\"first_name\" = \"Joe\" , \r\n\t\t\t\"last_name\" = \"Shmo\", \r\n\t\t\t\"email\" = \"jshmo@blahblah.com\", \r\n\t\t\t\"created_datetime\" = now()\r\n\t\t};\r\n\r\n\tnewID = dao.insert( table = \"users\", data = DATA );\r\n\t// newID would contain the record's auto-incremented PK value\r\n\t\r\n\t// DAO has a method queryParam() that wraps your values in \r\n\t// appropriate cfqueryparam tags.  The method takes 4 args:\r\n\t// value - required\r\n\t// cfsqltype - optional, will be guessed based on value.  Uses\r\n\t// common data type names, no need for the cf_sql_type... crap.\r\n\t// list - true/false; will pass to cfqueryparam list attribute\r\n\t// null - true/false; will pass to the cfqueryparam null attribute\r\n\t\r\n\t// Insert data (using mysql specific replace into syntax )\r\n\tnewID2 = dao.execute(\"\r\n\t\tREPLACE INTO users (id, `_id`, first_name, last_name, email, created_datetime)\r\n\t\tVALUES ( 1\r\n\t\t\t\t,#dao.queryParam(lcase(createUUID()),'varchar')#\r\n\t\t\t\t,#dao.queryParam('john')#\r\n\t\t\t\t,#dao.queryParam('deere')#\r\n\t\t\t\t,#dao.queryParam('jdeere@tractor.com')#\r\n\t\t\t\t,#dao.queryParam(now(), 'timestamp')#\r\n\t\t\t   )\r\n\t\");\r\n\t// newID2 would also contain the record's new PK value\r\n\t//This is true for insert and replace statements only.\r\n\r\n\t// Return all records in a table\r\n\tusers = dao.read( \"users\" );\r\n\r\n\t// Return all records using SQL - and cache it\r\n\tusers = dao.read( \r\n\t\tsql = \"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users\",\r\n\t\tcachedWithin = createTimeSpan(0,0,2,0)\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n```\r\n# The ORM'sh side of DAO\r\nThe second part of this library is an ORM'sh implementation of entity management.  It internally uses the \r\ndao.cfc (and dbtype specific CFCs), but provides an object oriented way of playing with your model.  Consider\r\nthe following examples:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\t// create instance of dao ( could be injected via your favorite DI library )\r\n\tdao = new dao( dsn = \"dao\" );\r\n\r\n\t// Suppose we have a model/User.cfc model cfc that extends \"BaseModelObject.cfc\"\r\n\tuser = new model.User( dao );\r\n\r\n\t// Create a new user named john.\r\n\tuser.setFirstName( 'john' );\r\n\tuser.setLastName( 'deere' );\r\n\tuser.setEmail('jdeere@tractor.com');\r\n\r\n\t// Save will insert the new record because it doesn't exist.  \r\n\t// If we had loaded the entity with a user record, it would perform an update.\r\n\tuser.save();\r\n\r\n\t// So the entity has been persisted to the database.  If we wanted\r\n\t// to at this point, we could use the user.getID() method to get the\r\n\t// value of the newly created PK.  Or we could do another update\r\n\tuser.setFirstName('Johnny');\r\n\tuser.save(); // Now the entity has been \"updated\" and persisted to the databse.\r\n\r\n\t// Now, to load data into an entity it's as simple as:\r\n\tuser = new model.User( dao );\r\n\tuser.load(1);  // assuming our record's ID == 1\r\n\r\n\t// We can also do crazy stuff like:\r\n\tuser.loadByFirstNameAndLastName('Johnny', 'deere');\r\n\t// Every property/field in the entity can be included in this dynamic load function\t\r\n\t// just prefix the function name as \"loadBy\" and delimit the field name criteria by \"And\"\r\n\tuser.loadByFirstNameAndLastNameAndEmailAndIDAndCreatedDate(....);\r\n\r\n\t// A model entity can also be used to load collections, not just a single member\r\n\tuser = new model.User( dao );\r\n\tusers = user.loadAll(); // <--- returns array of intitialized entity objects - one for each record\r\n\r\n\t// you can also filter using the dynamic load function\r\n\tusers = user.loadAllByFirstName('Johnny');\r\n\r\n\t// there is also a list function that will return a query object\r\n\tusers = user.list( where = \"FirstName = 'Johnny' \");\r\n\r\n\t// Even more coolness. We can return the entity (or collection) as an array, or JSON, or struct!\r\n\tuser.toStruct();\r\n\tuser.toJSON(); // <--- know that this is not the ACF to JSON crap, it's real serialized JSON.\r\n\r\n\t// Collection return types\r\n\tusers = user.listAsArray( where = \"FirstName = 'Johnny' \");\r\n\tusers = user.listAsJSON( where = \"FirstName = 'Johnny' \");\r\n\r\n```\r\nThat's the very basics of Entity management in DAO.  It get's real interesting when you start playing with\r\nrelationships.  By-in-large I have adopted the property syntax used by CF ORM to define\r\nentity properties and describe relationships.  Example: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/* Pet.cfc */\r\ncomponent persistent=\"true\" table=\"pets\" extends=\"com.database.BaseModelObject\" accessors=\"true\" {\r\n\r\n\tproperty name=\"ID\" type=\"numeric\" fieldtype=\"id\" generator=\"increment\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"_id\" fieldtype=\"id\" generator=\"uuid\" type=\"string\" length=\"45\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"userID\" type=\"numeric\" sqltype=\"int\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"firstName\" type=\"string\" column=\"first_name\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"lastName\" type=\"string\" column=\"last_name\";\t\r\n\tproperty name=\"createdDate\" type=\"date\" column=\"created_datetime\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"modifiedDate\" type=\"date\" column=\"modified_datetime\" formula=\"now()\";\r\n\r\n\t/* Relationships */\r\n\tproperty name=\"user\" inverseJoinColumn=\"ID\" cascade=\"save-update\" fieldType=\"one-to-one\" fkcolumn=\"userID\" cfc=\"model.User\";\r\n\tproperty name=\"offspring\" type=\"array\" fieldType=\"one-to-many\" singularname=\"kid\" fkcolumn=\"offspringID\" cfc=\"model.Offspring\";\r\n\r\n\tpublic string function getFullName(){\r\n\t\treturn variables.firstName & \" \" & variables.lastName;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen in development you can have dao create your tables for you by passing the dropcreate = true to the initializer.  Exmaple:\r\n```javascript\r\n\tuser = new User( dao = dao, dropCreate = true );\r\n```\r\nThis will inspect your CFC properties and create a table based on those details.  This supports having different property names vs column names, table names, data types, etc...\r\n\r\nThe \"Pet.cfc\" above would create a table named `pets` with an auto incrementing PK name `ID`, a \"varchar(45)\" `_id` field, a `userID` field with the type \"Int\"\r\nvarchar fields named `first_name` and `last_name` a datetime field named `created_datetime` and a datetime field named `modified_datetime`.\r\n\r\n* The _id field, will automatically generate a UUID value when a record is first created because we specified a generator UUID.\r\n* The getters/setters for first_name, last_name, craeted_datetime, modified_datetime would be:\r\n  * get/setFirstName();\r\n  * get/setLastName();\r\n  * get/setCreatedDate();\r\n  * get/setModifiedDate();\r\n* The modifiedDate will update with the evaluated value of \"now()\" each time the data is updated.\r\n* The dynamic load statements respect the name/column differences, so the loadByFirstName(\"?\") will essentially translate to \"first_name = ?\"\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Entities\r\nSometimes it's a pain in the arse to create entity CFCs that just point to a single table.  You must create properties for each field in the table.  This feature will allow you to define an entity class with minimal effort.  Here's an example of a dynamic entity CFC:\r\n```javascript\r\n/* EventLog.cfc */\r\ncomponent persistent=\"true\" table=\"eventLog\" extends=\"com.database.BaseModelObject\"{\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's all we *need*.  Now say I created a table named eventLog in my databse with the following:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `eventLog` (\r\n  `ID` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `event` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `description` text,\r\n  `eventDate` datetime DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)\r\n);\r\n```\r\nWhen I instantiate the EventLog.cfc with:\r\n```javascript\r\neventLog = new model.EventLog( dao = dao );\r\n```\r\nI'll get an instance of EventLog as if the CFC had included the following properties:\r\n```javascript\r\nproperty name=\"ID\" fieldtype=\"id\" generator=\"increment\";\r\nproperty name=\"event\" type=\"string\";\r\nproperty name=\"description\" type=\"string\";\r\nproperty name=\"eventDate\" type=\"date\";\r\n```\r\nTo make this work, just make sure you set the table attribute to point to the actual table in the database, extend BaseModelObject and set the persistent=true.  When you then create an instance of that CFC, the table (eventLog in the above example) will be examined and all the fields in that table will be injected into your instance - along with all the getters/setters.  This even works with identity fields (i.e. Primary Keys) and auto generated (i.e. increment) fields.\r\n\r\nYou can also mix and match.  You can statically define properties:\r\n```javascript\r\ncomponent persistent=\"true\" table=\"eventLog\" extends=\"com.database.BaseModelObject\" accessors=\"true\"{\r\n\tproperty name=\"description\" type=\"string\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd DAO will just inject the rest of the columns.  This is handy in cases where your table definition has been altered (i.e. new fields) as they will automatically be included.  For anything more than straight table entities (i.e. you need relationships, formulas, etc...) you still need to declare those properties in the CFC.  You also must statically define properties where you want the property name to be different than the table's column name. (NOTE: the DAO is smart enough to check for both when injecting properties)\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Entity - A step further\r\nI believe it's best to create entity CFCs that extend BaseModelObject, but... for dynamic entities you don't necessarily have to.  Here's what we could have done above without having to create EventLog.cfc:\r\n```javascript\r\neventLog = new com.database.BaseModelObject( dao = dao, table = 'eventLog' );\r\n```\r\nThat would have returned an entity instance with all the properties from the eventLog table.  I'm not saying this is a best practice, but it is possible.  It hasn't been tested in the wild, so YMMV - but it passes our internal manual tests.\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\nSince this Pet.cfc defines a one-to-one relationship with the user, this will automatically load the correct \"User\" object into the Pet object\r\nwhen the Pet object is instantiated.  If none exists it will load an un-initialized instance of User.  When a save is performed on Pet, the User\r\nis also evaluated and saved (if any changes were detected ).\r\n\r\nOne can also identify one-to-many relationships. This will also auto-load and \"cascade\" save unless told otherwise via the \"cascade\" attribute. This type of\r\nrelationship creates an Array of whatever object it is related to, and adds the `add<Entity Name>()` method to the instance so you can add instances to the array.  Notice in \r\nour Pets.cfc example we define a one-to-many relationship of \"offspring\" which maps to \"model.Offspring\".\r\n\r\n## lazy loading\r\nIf you are fortunate enough to be on Railo 4x or ACF10+ you can take advantage of lazy loading.  This dramatically improves performance when loading entities with a lot of related\r\nentities, or are loading a collection of entities that have related entities.  What it will do is load the parent entity and \"overload\" the getters methods of the child entities\r\nwith a customized getter that will first instantiate/load the child object, then return it's value.  This way, only child entities that are actually used/referenced will be loaded.\r\n\r\nTo lazy load, you simply use the dynamic load method, prefixed with \"lazy\"\r\n```javascript\r\npet = new Pet( dao ).lazyLoadAll();\r\n// then, if I only need the first name of the \"user\" for the second pet I'd just:\r\nownerName = pet[2].getFirstName();  // That would trigger the \"load\" on only the that pet's user object.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\nCurrently this library has been actively used and tested on Railo 4x, CF9 and CF10 (though the dao.cfc stuff should work with CF8 - for now). \r\nThere are some features that are disabled by default ( such as lazy loading child entities ), but can be \"turned on\" by un-commenting\r\na few lines if you are running on CF10+ or Railo 4+ (uses anonymous functions)\r\n\r\n# Database Platform Agnostic\r\nCurrently there are two databases that are supported: MySQL and MS SQL.  Others can be added by\r\ncreating a new CFC that implements the necessary methods.  The CFC  name would then be the \"dbtype\"\r\nargument passed to the init method when instantiating dao.cfc.  So if you have otherrdbs.cfc, you'd\r\ninstantiate as: dao = new dao( dbType = 'otherrdbs' );\r\n\r\n# More examples\r\nCheck out the daotest.cfm and entitytest.cfm files for a basic examples of the various features.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
